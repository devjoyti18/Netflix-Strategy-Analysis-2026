# 🍿 Netflix Content Strategy & 2026 Forecast
## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 15 years of Netflix library data to uncover shifting content strategies and global production trends. Using Python and Machine Learning, I developed a predictive model to forecast Netflix's content acquisition for the year 2026.
## 🚀 Key Insights
### The Series Pivot: 
Since 2018, the number of TV Shows added to the platform has grown 3x faster than Movies, signaling a shift toward long-term subscriber retention.
### Dominant Markets: 
The United States (Dramas) and India (International Movies) remain the largest content hubs, but South Korean content shows the highest upward momentum in recent years.
### Quality vs. Quantity: 
Analysis of genre ratings reveals that Documentaries are the most consistently high-rated category, suggesting a "safe bet" for quality-focused acquisitions.
## 📊 Predictive Modeling
I utilized Linear Regression to analyze the historical "velocity" of Netflix's content growth from 2008 to 2024.
2026 Prediction: The model forecasts approximately 2736 new titles will be added in 2026.
Model Confidence: Achieved an R^2 score of 0.78, indicating a high correlation between time and library expansion.🛠️ 
## Tech Stack & Methods
Python: Primary language for data manipulation.
Pandas: Used for data cleaning and "exploding" nested categorical strings (Genres/Countries).
Scikit-Learn: Employed for Linear Regression modeling and performance evaluation.Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used to create executive-level visualizations.
